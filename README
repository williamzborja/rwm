# Modern DWM project

This is an open source project with goal to modernize DWM(Dynamic Window Manager) add documentation
and developer manual to play with this efficient and beautiful WM.

**dwm - dynamic window manager: is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X**.

## Motivation

I try use windows manager because I want learn about graphics software with C.
I set config.h file without understand all internal behavior and when I see dwm.c file
receive 3000 lines of code it's code is amazing but with really bad maintainability and readability if I
take the time to debug and understand this code I want share this because C is simple language but
commonly place to code for machine but not for humans my goals is be this manager easier to learn internal parts.

## Goals

1. debug code and understand how it works.
2. Refactor code and build documentation
3. Add cmake and testing and add
4. Plan modern structure and add doc
5. change from  C to Rust Dynamic Windows manager and add doc.
6. Add patch to work in Mac and modern linux sorry windows.
7. Add modern plugins manager.

## Structure

I want separate all things dwm file have 300 lines


the desire structure is:

- config
- src
- test
- build
- plugins

#




Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
